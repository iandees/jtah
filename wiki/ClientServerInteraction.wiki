= Introduction =

This document is meant to describe the design of the interaction between the clients and the server.

= Details =

  # Client requests a job from server, giving a user token.
  # Server checks to see if any requests exist.
    # If there is a request, send it back to the client, mark it as "out", and note down the user that took the job.
      # Client requests data for the tile from OSM
      # For each zoom level from the one requested down to level 17:
        # Client transcodes the OSM data to SVG using Osmarender for that zoom
        # Client renders the SVG data to PNG
        # Client splits the PNG image into 256x256 tiles
        # Client uploads the PNG images
    # If there is no request, send back a "no work now" message.
